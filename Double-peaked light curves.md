The primary peak is a result of shock interacting with 
dense material around the progenitor material of the star. 
We focus on stars with compact stars 10^-3 <= R_c/R <= 10^-1 and 
mass of 10^âˆ’1 <= Mc/M <= 10, surrounded by extended envelopes that follow
n = 3/2 and n = 3 polytropic envelopes. Mass of the envelope should
be Me = M-Mc [[1]](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...838..130S/abstract).
